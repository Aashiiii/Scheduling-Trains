1. extra_arguments

This test checks the case when user provides more than required arguments.
 In this case the appropriate error message should be printed. The error
  message has been specified in the readme file.

2. extra_long_entry

This test case checks the case when the timetable entry is longer than 4096
 characters. In this case, code is supposed to skip this entry.

3. invalid_entries

This test case tests the case in which the timetable has all invalid
 entries - invalid time, wrong format, empty line, missing colons etc. This
  test checks whether the code is skipping these lines or not.

4. invalid_hour_argument

This test case checks whether the code correctly identifies that the time
 given as command line argument has invalid hour or not. In this case the
  code should exit properly with appropriate error message.

5. invalid_min_argument

This test case checks whether the code correctly identifies that the time
 given as command line argument has invalid minute or not. In this case the
  code should exit properly with appropriate error message.

6. invalid_sec_argument

This test case checks whether the code correctly identifies that the time
 given as command line argument has invalid second or not. In this case the
  code should exit properly with appropriate error message.

7. invalid_time_character_argument

This test case checks whether the code correctly identifies that the time
 given as command line argument has invalid characters or not. In this
  case the code should exit properly with appropriate error message.

8. invalid_time_format_argument

This test case checks whether the code correctly identifies that the time
 given as command line argument has invalid format or not. In this case
  the code should exit properly with appropriate error message.
Invalid format -  it has appropriate number of colons, correct digits, but
 it is not in the hh:mm:ss format.

9. large_timetable_neg

This is a negative test case that checks the condition when a large
 timetable is given as input, and there are no timetable entries which
  match the user's request.

10. large_timetable_nextday

This is a positive test case that checks the condition when a large
 timetable is given as input, and there are no timetable entries for the
  same day which match the user's request. The next train available is the
   next day.

11. large_timetable_sameday

This is a positive test case that checks the condition when a large
 timetable is given as input, and there are timetable entries for the same
  day which match the user's request. The next train is available the same
   day. 

12. no_dest_arg

This test case checks whether the code exits with appropriate error
 message or not when the user does not gives the destination argument.

13. no_source_arg

This test case checks whether the code exits with appropriate error
 message or not when the user does not gives the source argument.

14. no_time_arg

This test case checks whether the code exits with appropriate error
 message or not when the user does not gives the time argument.

15. single_station_neg

This is a negative test case that checks the condition when a timetable
 with sigle station is given as input, and there are no timetable entries
  which match the user's request.

16. single_station_pos_nextday

This is a positive test case that checks the condition when a timetable
 with single station is given as input, and there are no timetable entries
  for the same day which match the user's request. The next train
   available is the next day.

17. single_station_pos_sameday

This is a positive test case that checks the condition when a timetable
 with single station is given as input, and there are timetable entries
  for the same day which match the user's request. The next train is
   available the same day.

18. small_timetable_neg

This is a negative test case that checks the condition when a small
 timetable is given as input, and there are no timetable entries which
  match the user's request.

19. small_timetable_nextday

This is a positive test case that checks the condition when a small
 timetable is given as input, and there are no timetable entries for the
  same day which match the user's request. The next train available is the
   next day.

20. small_timetable_sameday

This is a positive test case that checks the condition when a small
 timetable is given as input, and there are timetable entries for the same
  day which match the user's request. The next train is available the same
   day. 

21. zedge_max_min_time

This is an edge test case that verifies the fu nctionality of code at time
 23:59:59 and 00:00:00. If user arrives at 23:59:59, then the next train
  available (if) can be at 00:00:00. We are using the same timetable for
   each day.

22. zedge_same_time

This is an edge test case which checks the functionality of code when the
 time in timetable entry matches the time of arrival of user at the
  station.
The user can board the train as soon as they arrive at the station.
